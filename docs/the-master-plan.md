# Chess Game - Master Planning Document

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive chess game web application featuring a digital wireframe aesthetic combined with sacred geometry elements. The game will initially focus on single-player gameplay against an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels, and include an interactive chess tutor to help players learn strategies and improve their skills.

## Core Value Proposition

- Beautiful, modern chess interface with unique digital wireframe + sacred geometry aesthetic
- Exceptional user experience with fluid animations and both mouse and keyboard controls
- Built-in AI opponent with adjustable difficulty
- Interactive chess tutor to help players learn and improve
- Simple, clean implementation focused on performance and maintainability

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API and script setup syntax
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: Vue 3 Reactivity API (ref, reactive, computed)
- **Typing**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Vue 3 scoped CSS with CSS Grid for the chessboard. I used a CSS reset from <https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/> in the style.css file in src as a global css file but feel free to adjust the placement of it as needed.
- **Animations**: Vue Transition components with GSAP for more complex animations
- **Chess Logic**: Custom implementation with potential assistance from a lightweight chess engine library
- **Storage**: Local Storage for saving games initially
- **Authentication**: Custom implementation using browser APIs
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Vue Testing Library for component tests

## Architecture Overview

The application will follow a component-based architecture with clean separation of concerns:

1. **Core Chess Engine**: Responsible for game state, move validation, and rules enforcement
2. **AI Module**: Chess AI implementation with difficulty settings
3. **UI Components**: Vue components for the board, pieces, controls, etc.
4. **Animation System**: Handles all visual feedback and transitions
5. **Chess Tutor Module**: Provides strategic advice and learning content
6. **Storage Module**: Handles saving/loading games
7. **Authentication System**: Simple user authentication

## Design Principles

1. **Visual Aesthetics**:

   - Digital wireframe style with sacred geometry patterns
   - Golden ratio proportions in piece design
   - Subtle background animations using geometric patterns
   - Glowing edges and clean lines
   - Consistent color scheme based on sacred geometry principles

2. **Animation Philosophy**:

   - Smooth, fluid transitions for all interactions
   - Purposeful animations that enhance understanding
   - Subtle effects that don't distract from gameplay
   - Visual feedback for all user actions

3. **Interaction Design**:
   - First-class keyboard navigation
   - Intuitive drag-and-drop
   - Clear visual cues for available moves
   - Immediate feedback for legal/illegal moves

## Key Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Efficient rendering of pieces and animations
   - Optimized AI calculations to prevent UI lag
   - Proper use of Vue's reactivity system and lifecycle hooks

2. **Accessibility**:

   - Full keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast considerations
   - Focus management

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Clean separation of chess logic from UI components
   - Composable functions for reusable logic
   - Reusable animation system
   - Modular AI implementation
   - Consistent typing with TypeScript

## Vue-Specific Patterns

1. **Composition API Best Practices**:

   - Use `<script setup>` syntax for cleaner, more concise components
   - Leverage Vue 3 composables for reusable logic
   - Utilize `ref`, `reactive`, and `computed` appropriately
   - Extract complex logic into separate composition functions

2. **Component Design**:
   - Props down, events up communication pattern
   - Provide/inject for deep component hierarchies
   - Teleport for modals and popups
   - Suspense for async components

## Future Expansion Possibilities

(Note: These are not part of the initial implementation)

1. **Multiplayer**: Online play with friends
2. **Advanced Analysis**: Deep game analysis and position evaluation
3. **Puzzle Mode**: Chess puzzles for practice
4. **Opening Library**: Study and practice chess openings
5. **Tournament Mode**: Create and participate in tournaments

## Next Steps

Proceed to implement each feature according to the detailed feature-specific markdown files, following the roadmap order. Each feature should be fully tested before proceeding to the next.
